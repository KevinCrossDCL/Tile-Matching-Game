# Tile-Matching-Game
 Tile Matching Game made in AppGameKit

The code is a of my game Tile Odyssey: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevincross.tileodyssey with a few tweaks.

The name has been changed to Tile Matching Game (including the title image in the game).

Google Ad ID's have been removed.

In the original game there are two sets of tiles, an icon set, and an art gallery set. The icon set was a purchased set of icons so I can't include those in this repository. Because of this I've had to copy the art gallery set into set 1. The app still has two sets so as to not break anything, but both sets are the same. You will need to replace one of the sets. The gallery art tiles were AI generated.

I've replaced a few buttons and icons like the shop and safe buttons because they were from a purchased set of icons. The rest of the icon images within the app are probably ok to use.

The sounds would have been downloaded from https://freesound.org

The code requires a framework I built in AGK called Zest Framework: https://github.com/KevinCrossDCL/Zest-Framework
